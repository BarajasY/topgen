# Togenim

This is a personal project in which users can find the best teams that the Genshin Impact game has to offer. Each team has an individual page that displays some of the traits of each character.

# Live
This project is currently hosted in [here](https://togenim.netlify.app/).

# Stack
Togenim is a full-stack application which uses the next technologies: 
### `React` `TypeScript` `HTML5` `CSS3` `Firebase`

# For me
Since this was my very first full-stack application which used TypeScript instead of JavaScript, it allowed me to better visualize the pros that this language has to offer, being able to enjoy the new capabilities of TS allowed me to consider the real value that the language has to offer.
Perhaps we could way this project envisioned me to learn more about TS.
